<h1>Punch, or the London Charivari</h1>

<h2>Volume 105, July 15TH 1893</h2>

<h3><i>edited by Sir Francis Burnand</i></h3>

<hr class="full" />

<h2 class="sans">AN AFTERNOON PARTY.</h2>

<p> ... "The room is full of celebrities. Do you see that tall woman
in black, talking to the little old lady? That is Mrs. <span class="sc">Arbuthnot</span>&mdash;a
woman of some importance&mdash;and the other is <span class="sc">Charley's</span> Aunt.
The sporting-looking young man is Captain <span class="sc">Coddington</span>, who is
'in town' for the season."</p>

<p>"And who are the two men, exactly alike, tall and dark, who are
smoking gold-tipped cigarettes, and talking epigrams?" I asked.
I like to know who people are, and the person in the silver domino
seemed well-informed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/013-600.png"><img src="images/013-300.png" width="300" height="444" alt="'The uninvitable in pursuit of the indigestible,' murmured Lord Illingworth." border="0" /></a>
<p class="center">"The uninvitable in pursuit of the indigestible," murmured Lord Illingworth.</p></div>

<p>"Those are Lord <span class="sc">Illingworth</span>, and Lord <span class="sc">Henry Wotton</span>.
They always say exactly the same things. They are awfully
clever, and cynical. Those two ladies talking together are known
as <span class="sc">Nora</span> and <span class="sc">Dora</span>. There's rather a
curious story about each of them."</p>

<p>"There seems to be one about
everyone here," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, it seems that <span class="sc">Nora</span> and her
husband did not get on very well. He
thought skirt-dancing morbid. Also,
he forgave her for forging his name&mdash;in
type-writing&mdash;to a letter refusing
to subscribe to a wedding-present for
Princess <span class="sc">May</span>. She said a man who
would forgive a thing like that would
forgive anything. So she left the
Dolls' House."</p>

<p>"Quite right. Is that not the
Comtesse <span class="sc">Zicka</span>? I seem to recognise
the scent."</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;and the beautiful Italian
lady is Madame <span class="sc">Santuzza</span>. One meets
all sorts of people here, you know;
by the way, there's Mrs. <span class="sc">Tanqueray</span>."</p>

<p>"Princess <span class="sc">Salomé</span>!" announced
the servant. A little murmur of surprise
seemed to go round the room as
the lovely Princess entered.</p>

<p>"What <i>has</i> she got on?" asked
<span class="sc">Portia</span>.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing," replied Mr.
<span class="sc">Walker</span>, London.</p>

<p>"I thought she was not received in
English society," said Lady <span class="sc">Windermere</span>,
puritanically.</p>

<p>"I can assure you, my dears, that
she would not be tolerated in Brazil,
where the nuts come from," exclaimed
<span class="sc">Charley's</span> Aunt.</p>

<p>"There's no harm in her. She's
only a little peculiar. She is particularly
fond of boar's head. It's nothing,"
said Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span>.</p>

<p>"The uninvitable in pursuit of the
indigestible," murmured Lord <span class="sc">Illingworth</span>,
as he lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Is that mayonnaise?'" asked the
Princess <span class="sc">Salomé</span> of Captain <span class="sc">Coddington</span>, who had taken her to
the
buffet. "I think it is mayonnaise. I am sure it is mayonnaise.
It is mayonnaise of salmon, pink as a branch of coral which fishermen
find in the twilight of the sea, and which they keep for the
King. It is pinker than the pink roses that bloom in the Queen's
garden. The pink roses that bloom in the garden of the Queen of
Arabia are not so pink."</p>

<p>"Who's the jaded-looking Anglo-Indian, drinking brandy-and-soda?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"That is a Plain young man. From the Hills. Which is curious.
I am much attached to him. By the way, I know who I am. And
why I wear a silver domino. You don't."</p>

<p>"That's another story," I said. "Let's go to the smoking-room.
We shall find the Eminent Person, the Ordinary Man, the Poet, the
Journalist, and the Mere Boy, and they will all say delightful
things on painful subjects."</p>

<p>"Barry Paynful," suggested the Mere Boy, with his usual impossibility.
They were trying to "draw" Lord <span class="sc">Illingworth</span>.</p>

<p>"What is a good woman?" asked the Journalist.</p>

<p>"A woman who admires bad men," answered Lord <span class="sc">Illingworth</span>.</p>

<p>"What is a bad man?"</p>

<p>"A man who smokes gold-tipped cigarettes."</p>

<p>"Which would you rather, or go fishing?" inquired the Mere
Boy, irreverently.</p>

<p>"Because it's a jar, of course. There are two kinds of women,
the plain and the coloured. But all art is quite useless."</p>

<p>"I say!" exclaimed Lord <span class="sc">Henry</span>, taking from his friend's
pocket a gold match-box, curiously carved, and wrought with his
initials in chrysoprases and peridots. "I say, you know,
<span class="sc">Illingworth</span>&mdash;come&mdash;that's
mine. I said it to <span class="sc">Dorian</span> only the other
evening. You're always saying my things."</p>

<p>"Well, what then? It is only the obvious and the tedious who
object to quotations. When a man says life has exhausted him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We know that he has exhausted life."</p>

<p>"Women are secrets, not sphinxes."</p>

<p>"Mine again," exclaimed Lord <span class="sc">Henry</span>.</p>

<p>"It would be useful to carry a little book to note down your good
things."</p>

<p>"Very useful. And I can forgive a man for making a useful
thing as long as he does not admire it."</p>

<p>"That's New Humour, isn't it? And you're a New Humourist?"
said <span class="sc">Walker</span>, satirically. "Why, it's a contradiction in itself!
The very essence of a joke is, that it
should be old. Where would you find
anything funnier than the riddle,
'When is a door not a door?' and,
'Why does a miller wear a white
hat?' Ah! it won't last&mdash;we're
bound to go back to the 'Old Humour'&mdash;there's
nothing like it&mdash;what is that
noise?"</p>

<p>"A dispute has arisen in the ladies'
cloak-room about a shawl. It's frightfully
thrilling!" said <span class="sc">Hilda Wangel</span>.</p>

<p>"They seem to be going on anyhow.
It's nothing," said <span class="sc">Walker</span>.</p>

<p>It appears that <span class="sc">Charley's</span> Aunt
had accused Princess <span class="sc">Salomé</span> of taking
her shawl. The Princess had indignantly
thrown it at her, and was
making rather rude personal remarks
about it.</p>

<p>"I don't want your shawl. Your
shawl is hideous. It is covered with
dust. It is a tartan shawl. It is
like the shawl worn in melodrama by
the injured heroine who is about to
throw herself over the bridge by moonlight.
It is the shawl of a betrayed
heroine in melodrama. There never
was anything so hideous as your
shawl!"</p>

<p>"Impertinence! To dare to speak
to me like this! I'm the success of
the season, and <i>you</i> were forbidden
the country," said <span class="sc">Charley's</span> Aunt,
furiously.</p>

<p>The second Mrs. <span class="sc">Tanqueray</span> here
chimed in, giving her opinion, which
did not add to the harmony of the
gathering, and a secondary quarrel
was going on, because Captain <span class="sc">Coddington</span>
had said that the scent Comtesse
<span class="sc">Zicka</span> used "was not quite up to
date," and the latter was offended.
In fact, there was a regular row all
round. <span class="sc">Nora</span> banged her tambourine, and <span class="sc">Walker</span> playfully
pretended
to hide his head behind Lady <span class="sc">Windermere's</span> fan.</p>

<p><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'A'">At</ins> last, however, we managed to calm the indignant ladies, and
the party began to break up.</p>

<p>"The fact is," I said, "Society is getting a great deal too mixed.
Now, I like to go away from an afternoon party feeling a purer and
better man, my eyes filled with tears of honest English sentiment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Great Scott! don't go on like that. Come and have a drink,"
said the <span class="sc">Silver Domino</span>.</p>

<p>"Valour is the better part of indiscretion," murmured Lord
<span class="sc">Illingworth</span>. "Good-bye, <span class="sc">Henry</span>. It has been a most interesting
afternoon."</p>

<h2>ROSEBERY TO THE RESCUE!</h2>

<p class="ind1"><span class="outdent"><i>Or, the Young Squire,</i></span> <i>the Unjust Steward, and the Grateful Ratepayer.
An Urban Drama, as lately performed at the County Hall, Spring
Gardens.</i></p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> Steward, <i>bearing plans of a splendid, and expensive,
Palace</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Steward (looking lovingly upon plan).</i> Aha! Now shall I
triumph, despite mean Moderates, and cheese-paring Economists,
and reluctant Ratepayers. <span class="sc">Gr-r-r!</span> how I hate the whole
penurious brood! Housed appropriately I must and will be, though
Rate Incidence be as yet ill-adjusted, and that blessed word Betterment
be but an ear-soothing sound. But hold!&mdash;she comes!</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Injured, but Beauteous, Ratepayer, <i>wringing her hands</i>.</p>

<p><i>I. but B. R. (aside).</i> Hah! Whom have we here? Merciless
Master <span class="sc">D-ck-ns-n</span>, as I'm a living woman! Was't not enough that
Vestries should vex me, Boards o'erburden me, Pedagogues oppress,
and Precepts perplex, but <i>he</i> too must turn against me? (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Give you good den, Master D.! Hast news of comfort for me?</p>

<p><i>Steward (harshly).</i> Woman, I know not what <i>thou</i> wilt deem news
of comfort. But if a superb site and a splendid structure (<i>pointing
to Plan</i>) have charms for thy something straitened and sordid soul,
then, verily&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>I. but B. R. (shrieking as she catches sight of the Plan, and the
fair round Figures attached thereto).</i> Alas, Mr. Steward! 'tis, as
thou sayst, superb&mdash;splendid&mdash;and, what is more, prodigiously
<i>expensive</i> withal! It is <i>magnifique</i>, but it is <i>not</i>&mdash;Economy!</p>

<p><i>Steward (scornfully).</i> Expensive? Pooh! What matters a
Million or twain so London's Guardians be well housed?</p>

<p><i>I. but B. R.</i> But, in the words of the old game, where's the
money to come from? Moreover, is it not understood that <i>all</i>
Metropolitan Improvements be postponed till such time as those ghouls
of ground-renters, those ogres of property-owners, are compelled
proportionally to disgorge?</p>

<p><i>Steward.</i> Ahem! Truly so! But verily <i>this</i> matter is exceptional
and urgent. "Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat;" and
they who superintend the People's housing should surely themselves
be adequately, not to say magnificently, housed. As to the
money&mdash;why, fear not for thy pockets Dame, which are not yet
utterly depleted by that Briarean blood-sucker, <span class="sc">Bumble</span>. Why, we
shall right soon save the money in cab-fares, and&mdash;ahem!&mdash;other
comforts and conveniences for our committees, not to mention the
purchasing of supplementary tenements "at the rate of two houses
a year." Oh, be content, Dame; pay up, and look pleasant!
(<i>Imperatively.</i>)</p>

<p><i>I. but B. R. (frantically).</i> Alas! Is there, then, no hope? Will <i>no</i>
one bring a rescue or two? "Oh, where is County (Council) Guy?"</p>

<p><i>Enter the</i> Young Squire, <i>hastily</i>.</p>

<p><i>Young Squire (hurriedly arrived from heavy business and urgent
elsewhere, but impelled by a sense of public duty to intervene on this
occasion).</i> <span class="sc">Here!!</span> (<i>Chord.</i>) Be consoled, Dame&mdash;<i>I</i> will
protect
thee! And for thee, Sir Steward, what the mischief art up to, with
thy Aladdin Palaces, and thine Odd Millions?</p>

<p><i>Steward (confused, and displaying Plan).</i> Why, my lord&mdash;deeming
it befitting&mdash;that so illustrious and important and ubiquitously
influential a Body&mdash;as&mdash;Ourselves&mdash;should have a Local Habitation&mdash;as
well as a Name&mdash;I have prepared&mdash;this little Plan&mdash;which, with
the aid&mdash;of "a little cheque"&mdash;say for a trifle of Two Millions&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Young Squire (snatching Plan from his grasp and gazing angrily
thereon).</i> Aha! A veritable Castle in the Air! An Arabian Nights'
Phantom Palace!! The House that Jack (in Office) <i>would have</i>
built!!! (<i>Tears it, and treads it under foot.</i>) Nay, Sir Steward,
thou hast much misunderstood thy trust. The housing of the poor,
rather than of the rich, is thy prime function. Attend first to this
little list of Metropolitan Improvements, which cannot be unfamiliar
to thine ears and eyes. Or if <i>they</i> must perforce be postponed until the
attainment of "a fairer adjustment of the incidence of taxation,"
prythee, <i>à fortiori</i>, postpone also until that uncertain date this
precious scheme for an expensive Municipal Palace, and this premature
and impudent assault upon an already sufficiently depleted Pocket!</p>

<p><i>I. but B. R. (clasping her hands in gratitude).</i> Ah, thanks, noble
youth! Heaven reward thee for thy magnanimous championship
of the poor gyurl's purse!</p>

<p><i>Steward (aside).</i> Foiled!!! But no mattah! a time will come!!!</p>

<h3>OPERATIC NOTES.</h3>

<p><i>Tuesday, July 4. State Visit to the Opera.</i>&mdash;Yes, "<span class="sc">Todgers's</span>
could do it when it liked," as <span class="sc">Charles Dickens</span> remarked in <i>Martin
Chuzzlewit</i>, and Sir <span class="sc">Coventgardensis Druriolanus</span> can do it when
<i>he</i> likes, rather! The front of the house is quite a "mask of flowers,"
which the Master of the Gray's Inn Revels, himself present in a
gorgeous and awe-inspiring uniform, regards with a benign and
appreciative smile. Interesting
to note a number of
ordinarily quiet and unobtrusive
individuals, personally
known to me as the
mildest-mannered men, who
now appear as the fiercest,
and, on such a night, the
hottest of warriors; seeing
that if it is 98 in the shade,
the temperature must be ten
degrees higher to those who
are buttoned up to the chin
in a military uniform, with
straps, belts, buckles, boots,
weighted too with a dangling,
clattering sword, and
having to carry about a
thickly-furred hat, with a
plume in it like a shaving-brush,
that obstinately
refuses to be hung up, or
sat upon, or put out of
sight, in any sort of way
whatever, and which,
like a baby in arms, must
be carried,&mdash;or dropped.
The Venetians on the stage
in all their mediæval
bravery are not arrayed
like one of these simple
English yeomen, for, as I
am given to understand, to
that glorious body of our
country's agricultural defenders
do these dashing
Hussars, in their Hessian-fly
boots, belong! Ah! with such warriors England is safe!</p>

<p>Then there are what <i>Mr. Weller</i> would have termed "My
Prooshan Blues," and likewise the diplomatic Muscovite, in hard-looking
cap, blue, naval-looking coat, and (apparently) flannel
boating trousers, falling, rather short, on to ordinary boots, with
plain unornamental spurs; a costume which, on the whole, suggests
that its wearer, at the command of the Autocrat of all the Russias,
must be ready at a second's notice to execute a forced march, dance
a hornpipe, run as a footman, take somebody up as a policeman,
head a cavalry charge, or (still in spurs) steer a torpedo boat on its
dangerous errand. Opera going strong, with the <span class="sc">De Frisky</span> Bros.
&amp; Co. The Last Act (by Royal Command) is omitted, and so for the
first time in dramatic history the story of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> ends as
happily as possible. The lovers are only interrupted by the fall of the
curtain, and there are no sleeping draughts, poisonings, or burials. It
is a realisation of the line in <i>The Critic</i>, "In the Queen's name
I charge you all to drop your swords and daggers!" Only the
order is given in the Princess's name, and the swords, daggers, and
deadly draughts are all dropped accordingly. Greatest possible
success. <i>Gloria</i> <span class="sc">Druriolano</span>!</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;First performance of <i>I Rantzau</i>, and first-rate
performance, too. The Plot is simply a Plot of Land. Scene laid&mdash;laid
for seven <i>dramatis personæ</i>&mdash;in a Vague Village of the
Vosges; time, present century. The Rantzaus are the Capulets
and Montagues of this district; the son of one faction is in love
with the daughter of the other; but it doesn't end tragically, and
the lovers marry. That's all. It was played as a Drama at the
Français, with <span class="sc">Got</span> in it; when subsequently it was turned into an
Opera, it had the "Go" taken out of it. <span class="sc">De Lucia</span>, <span class="sc">Ancona</span>,
<span class="sc">Castelmary</span>, <span class="sc">Bispham</span>, and <span class="sc">Corsi</span> doing their very best,
as do
also the lamplighter and his assistant, who deftly perform their
"Wagnerian watchman" "business" to characteristic music.
Mlle. <span class="sc">Bauermeister</span> great in a small part; and Madame <span class="sc">Melba</span>
does her very best with the singularly uninteresting part of <i>Luisa</i>,
who is a very "Limited Loo." Signor <span class="sc">Mascagni</span> conducted the
Opera, and was himself conducted on to the stage as often as possible
in order to receive the congratulations of his "friends in
front." <i>I Rantzau</i> not "in it" with <span class="sc">Mascagni's</span> <i>Cavalleria</i>,
which,
like the Rantzau family at the end of the piece, "still holds the field."
Thermometer 95° in the stalls. House animated and appreciative.</p>

shamefoolly the County Counsellors is a trying for to destroy the grand
old Copperation, and take pusession of Gildhal and the Manshun
House, he had the courage to assemble round his ospiterbel Table all
the most princiblest of the great writers of our wunderful and
powerful Press, and let them judge for theirselves whether sich a
hinstitootion as he represented was worth preserwin or not! Ah,
that was sumthink like a Bankwet that was! Why amost eweryboddy
was there as was anyboddy. And the ony trubble as that
caused was, that they was all so jolly glad to meet each other, under
sitch unusual suckemstances, that nothink on airth coud keep em
quiet, no, not ewen when the Amerrycan Embassader torked to em
for about arf a nour!</p>

at least, that he pronounced it <i>ass</i> with the
vowel short, and not ass, for it shows that
he has at least a certain regard for the
Queen's English (<i>The</i> Crowd <i>hasten to give
the vowel sound all the breadth in their
power</i>). I think I was&mdash;(<i>here he consults a
sheaf of notes</i>)&mdash;offering some remarks upon
Mr. <span class="sc">William Wobler</span>. Now we are told,
"Speak evil of no man!"</p>

<p><i>The Crowd.</i> That's a good un! 'Oo spoke
evil of Mr. <span class="sc">Bagwind</span> jest now?</p>

<p><i>The Orator</i> (<i>mildly hurt</i>). I never said a
single unkind word about Mr. <span class="sc">Bagwind</span>!</p>

<p><i>The Crowd.</i> Yer lie! Why, didn't you
say as he murdered <span class="sc">Jettison</span> and <span class="sc">Scapegoat</span>?
Wot yer call <i>that</i>, eh?</p>

<p class="center">"I say&mdash;<i>Never!</i>"</p></div>

<p><i>The Orator.</i> I may have made some such
observation&mdash;but far be it from me to speak
evil of any man. If I spoke evil, it was on
public grounds. I should scorn to attack
any individual in his private character. I
think I have satisfactorily answered <i>that</i>
matter. And I tell you this&mdash;it is largely
owing to me that Mr. <span class="sc">William Wobler</span>
owes his seat in Parliament to-day! (<i>His
hearers receive this with frank incredulity.</i>)
Ah, but it <i>is</i>, though, and I denounce him,
as I have denounced him before, and <i>shall</i>
denounce him while I have power to raise
my voice, as a man who has proved himself
utterly unworthy of the efforts I have made
on his behalf. Some people are saying they
want <span class="sc">Thomas Tiddler</span> in North Paddington.
I say&mdash;<i>Never!</i> Not as long as I've breath in
my body shall <span class="sc">Thomas Tiddler</span> be returned
for any constituency! No, gentlemen: here
I stand before you, with no money, and
only one lung. I have rich and high relations,
to whom I might apply for relief if I
condescended to do so; but I scorn to abase myself in any such
manner. I prefer to appeal to you, the people of London. It's a
disgrace&mdash;a public disgrace&mdash;that you people should allow such a
man as myself to walk the streets without food! (<i>A voice.</i> "Why
don't yer <i>work</i>?") Work? Am I <i>not</i> working? Am I not in my
proper place here to-night?</p>

<p><i>The Crowd</i> (<i>with hearty unanimity</i>). No!</p>

<p><i>The Orator</i> (<i>with exultation</i>). Then support me in the name of all
you hold dear! I have my work to accomplish, and I <i>shall</i>
accomplish it by the aid of the People's pence, by the aid of the
People's sixpences,&mdash;aye, and by the aid of the People's <i>shillings</i>!
<i>Will</i> you help me?</p>

<p><i>The Crowd</i> (<i>more heartily than ever</i>). No!</p>

<p><i>The Orator.</i> Then I will now proceed to make a collection.</p>

<p class="ind1"><span class="outdent">[<i>He descends</i></span> <i>from his stool, and circulates among the crowd
proffering a highly respectable hat. A</i> Rival Orator <i>mounts
the stool; he has a straw hat, side whiskers, and a style of
concentrated and withering invective</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Rival Orator</i> (<i>fluently, and with much enjoyment of his own
eloquence</i>). I shall preface what I have to say by protesting in the
strongest terms at my disposal against the most disgraceful attack
we have had the pain of listening to to-night, against the character
of a Statesman we all revere, by the unspeakably offensive and
degraded individual with a black coat, a clean collar, and only one
lung, who has just concluded his contemptible remarks, and is now
debasing himself, if possible, still further by going round cringing,
actually cringing, for the miserable halfpence which he hopes his
foul-mouthed virulence will extract from the more foolish among
his hearers! (<i>Applause at this spirited opening; the</i> First Orator
<i>imperturbably continues to protrude his hat</i>.) I have no hesitation in
saying that if such language as he has favoured us with was uttered
against a public man in any other community, in any other country,
in any other hemisphere in the civilized globe, the audience would
have risen in righteous indignation, and chased the cowardly
aggressor back to the vile den from whose obscurity he would have
done better never to emerge! Gentlemen, he has appealed to your
sympathy on the ground, forsooth, that he has only one lung! I
venture to assert that it is nothing short of a public calamity that he
<i>is</i> the possessor of one lung; for had he none at all, he would have
been incapable of outraging the general intelligence by the utterance
of such sentiments as he has disgusted you by this evening.
When I first became acquainted with this man, before he had sunk
into the besotted state in which he now wallows,
he used, I remember, to condemn the
practice of making a public collection. Now
I've never been against that practice myself.
<i>I</i> hold that a man who is capable of attracting
an audience by such gifts of oratory
as he may possess, is perfectly justified in
making a collection afterwards, whether he
requires the money or not. But this person
has become so degraded, so destitute of any
sense of honour, so soaked and sodden with
gin, that he now turns round on the principles
he once professed, and is to be seen
going round with a hat laden with the
coppers of those who are infinitely worse off
than&mdash;judging from his dress and prosperous
appearance&mdash;he evidently is himself!</p>

<p><i>The First Orator</i> (<i>exhibiting his empty hat</i>).
It don't look much like it at present, <span class="sc">Gabbitt</span>!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Gabbitt.</i> He has boasted to you of having
rich relations, and said he scorned to apply to
them. I want to know why, instead of coming
here begging to you, he <i>don't</i> go to them?</p>

<p><i>The First Orator.</i> I've <i>been</i>, <span class="sc">Gabbitt</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. G.</i> (<i>triumphantly</i>). You hear? he's
been to them. That proves they've found him
out; they know him for the grovelling soaker
he is, a wretch tottering on the verge of delirium
tremens, and, rightly, they'll have
nothing to do with him. It's very possible,
gentlemen, that he <i>may</i> have rich relations
in the place where most of us have rich
relations&mdash;I refer to the workhouse! (<i>Cheers
and laughter.</i>) And it is this wretch, this
indescribable mixture of meanness and malignity,
who has dared to come here and charge
Mr. <span class="sc">Bagwind</span> with crime! He asked you&mdash;and
let him not deny it now&mdash;"What about
Mr. <span class="sc">Scapegoat</span>?" Well, there may be a
good many things about Mr. <span class="sc">Scapegoat</span>, but
what I tell <i>you</i> is&mdash;an observation like that
is one that doesn't convey any concrete idea
whatever; in short, it is the observation of a
drivelling and confirmed lunatic!</p>

<p><i>Voice in the Crowd.</i> With on'y one lung; don't forgit that, ole man!</p>

<p><i>Mr. G.</i> (<i>magnanimously</i>). No, I've done with his lung, now; it
doesn't do to carry personalities too far, and I've disposed of that
already, and have no desire to return to it. And, as I observe that
the wretched object of the strictures which I have felt it my duty to
express, has concluded his efforts with the hat, and met with the
freezing contempt and indifference which are only to be expected
from intelligent and fair-minded men like yourselves, I will now
bring my exposure of the sophistries, the base insinuations, and the
incoherent maunderings which he had the effrontery to impose upon
your understandings as argument, to a premature close, and proceed
to make a collection on my own account, and thereby afford you the
opportunity of showing on which side your real sympathies and your
confidence are enlisted.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="outdent1">[<i>He goes round</i></span> <i>with the straw hat, which his delighted audience fill

manner with his adversary, who shows a true elevation of mind in
betraying no abiding resentment at his oratorical defeat. So may

<h3>"THE PLAY IS NOT THE THING."</h3>

tolerated for a single Night.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Auditorium of the

Comedy. Enter a party
of four</i> Playgoers <i>into

<p><i>First Playgoer.</i> Rather a
pity it has begun! I always
like to see a play from first
to last. Don't you?</p>

<p><i>Second P.</i> Quite. So
much more interesting. Of
course if you don't catch
what they say at first, how
on earth can you catch the
idea of the plot?</p>

<p><i>Third P.</i> Not that the
plot matters much nowadays.
All dialogue, don't
you know? Smart hits at
somebody, and all that sort
of thing.</p>

<p><i>Fourth P.</i> Quite. Really
better fun than the other sort
of thing. Much better fun
to have to listen to epigrams
and all that sort of thing,
than to have to follow something
or other with interest.</p>

<p><i>Second P.</i> Quite. In fact,
nowadays, you can come in
when you like, and listen to
what you like.</p>

<p><i>Third P.</i> Yes, much better
plan, than having to take it
all in. Think it a first-rate
idea to allow talking all
through, instead of keeping
that sort of thing until between
the Acts.</p>

<p><i>Second P.</i> Quite. Between
the Acts a fellow wants to
smoke. Much jollier to talk
when the other fellows are
talking too. Divide the labour
with them&mdash;half the
conversation on one side the
Curtain, half on the other.</p>

<p><i>Fourth P.</i> Capital idea,
and much less fatiguing
than the old style. Fancy
having to take it all in!
Why, ten years ago, one had
to get up a play as if one had
to pass an examination in it
next morning! Awful bosh!</p>

<p><i>Second P.</i> Quite. No, it's
much jollier to chat. Is there
anyone in the house you
know?</p>

<p><i>First P.</i> Only that Johnnie
over there! The fellow
in the dinner-jacket, who's
gone to sleep. He's rather
a sportsman. (<i>Applause.</i>)
Hallo! What's that row
about?</p>

<p><i>Third P.</i> End of the First
Act. I say, you fellows,
I don't think there's much
in the piece, so far.</p>

<p><i>Fourth P.</i> I am blest if I
know what it's all about.</p>

<p><i>First P.</i> More do I.</p>

<p><i>Second P.</i> And I. Why
should we stay any longer?
Seems awful rot.</p>

<p><i>Fourth P.</i> Quite. Let's
go to a Music-Hall, where
we can smoke and chat.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4><span class="sc">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span></h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 3.</i>&mdash;The
fat in the fire again. Who put it there?
"I," said <span class="sc">Joey C.</span>, "with my ready ladle;
I swooped it in." So he did, lighting up
with sudden flame embers that seemed quite
dead. At end of speech on <span class="sc">Wolmer's</span>
Amendment, seeing <span class="sc">John Dillon</span> sitting
opposite, asked him what about few remarks
made at Castlerea, in which he had threatened,
when Irishmen came to their own on
College Green, they would have police,
sheriffs, and bailiffs, under their control, and
would "remember" their enemies? <span class="sc">Dillon</span>,
amid scene of tumultuous excitement, admitted
that phrase not in itself defensible,
but pleaded that words had been spoken amid
great provocation. The massacre at Mitchelstown
had taken place just before; its memories
were hot within him, and, out of the
indignation of his heart, his tongue had
spoken.</p>

<p>As <span class="sc">Dillon</span> urged this plea, <span class="sc">T. W. Russell</span>
made a hurried remark in <span class="sc">Joseph's</span> ear.
J. smiled grimly; the Lord had delivered the
enemy into his hand. Some men would have
maimed their chance, if not spoiled the game,
by jumping up with hot interruption, and
hurriedly exposed the blunder upon which
<span class="sc">Dillon</span> had stumbled. <span class="sc">Joseph</span> never loses
his head. He lay low, sayin' nuffin', but
regarding the unconscious victim opposite
with dangerously smiling face. When <span class="sc">Dillon</span>
sat down, the crowded House plainly
moved by his effective speech, <span class="sc">Joseph</span> literally
leaped to his feet, and flung across the
floor the most complete and dramatic blow
ever dealt at a man in House of Commons.
It was Mitchelstown, was it, that had
rankled in <span class="sc">Dillon's</span> breast when he uttered
the phrase he now regretted? Would the
House believe that the massacre at Mitchelstown
took place on September 9, 1887, and
this speech at Castlerea was made on December
5, 1886?</p>

<p>"Remember Mitchelstown!" <span class="sc">John Dillon</span>
had remembered it nine months and
four days before it had taken place. Several
moments the Unionists cheered, <span class="sc">Joseph</span>
standing with accusatory finger pointed at
<span class="sc">John Dillon</span>, who sat silent with folded arms, the habitual pallor
of his face changed to a ghastlier white.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>
<p>"My dear <span class="sc">John</span>," I said to him later, "how on earth could you
make such a terrible mistake? The only amelioration it has is
that it was so stupendous and obvious that it was plainly stumbled
upon without intent or purport to deceive."</p>

<p>"Thank you, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," said <span class="sc">John Dillon</span>. "I suppose that is
clear enough to the generous mind. But I know a blunder is sometimes
worse than a crime. The fact is, about the time I spoke at
Castlerea, things were so bad in Ireland, the police so little hesitating
to shoot, that I got mixed up in my dates, and remembered
Mitchelstown when I was thinking about something else."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Home-Rule Bill in Committee.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Tritton</span> descending amongst the minnows has brought
up <span class="sc">Conybeare</span>. Not much heard of late of that eminent legislator.
Seems he's been compensating
enforced
silence in House by
"saying things" of
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> in letter to
newspaper. More than
hints <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, moved
by political motives,
has acted unfairly in
Chair. Perhaps <span class="sc">Tritton</span>
had done better to
leave him alone. Comparatively
few were
aware of the little
excursion into print.
Now blazoned forth to
all the world. Since
'twas done 'twas well
'twas done admirably.
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> moved to one
of those outbursts of
passionate though restrained
eloquence of
which, upon occasion,
he shows himself
capable. As Baron
<span class="sc">Ferdy</span> remarks:&mdash;"Since
<span class="sc">G.P.R. James</span>
was sent as Consul to
Venice, the only city
in the world where the
solitary horseman of
his many novels could
not be 'observed,'
nothing so quaint as
condemning one of the
few parliamentary
orators of the day to the
silence of the Chair."</p>

<p>Mr. G. delivered
brief but magnificent
speech, instinct with the true spirit of Parliamentarian. <span class="sc">Prince
Arthur</span> said a few words; everybody looked round for <span class="sc">Curse Of
Camborne</span> but unwonted access of modesty had seized him. Here was
opportunity with crowded House waiting on his words. And where
was he? Not in his place; so episode closed.</p>

<p>Though <span class="sc">Conybeare's</span> intention probably not kindly meant,
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> certainly under considerable obligation to him. Opportunity
afforded House of enthusiastically applauding the most
capable, dignified, upright <span class="sc">Speaker</span> that ever faced the fierce light
that beats upon the Chair of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Came across <span class="sc">Herbert Maxwell</span> just now; haven't seen him since
Saturday; met at dinner to Art and Literature given at Mansion
House by Lord Mayor <span class="sc">Knill</span>. "<span class="sc">Bayard</span> finished his speech yet?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Not sure," said <span class="sc">Maxwell</span>; "fancy not. When I was carried
out, in state approaching coma, I observed on table before him two
or three other volumes of manuscript, containing further passages
of the prodigious recitation."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bayard</span> is the new American Minister, doncha; made his first
public appearance at the Mansion House on Saturday; felt he must
rise to occasion; and did.</p>

<p>"Yours is a mere speck of a country, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," he said, before
we went in to dinner. "Your public speeches are, very properly,
planned in proportion. Now America, as you may have heard, is a
vast Continent, and I've got up a little thing to scale."</p>

<p>"Otherwise a very pleasant dinner," said <span class="sc">Maxwell</span>. "I sat next
to a Citizen and Loriner. Don't know what a Loriner is, but fancy,
from look in my friend's eyes, it's something to do with fish.
When turtle soup appeared on table there was phosphorescent
gleam in the worthy Loriner's eyes. He prodded me genially in ribs
with a fat elbow, and said with ungent chuckle, 'Ah, I s'pose you
writing fellows don't often sit down to a dinner like <i>this</i>?'"</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee on Home-Rule Bill. Much cry and
few Amendments.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;At ten o'clock to-night guillotine descended; simultaneously
Opposition lost their head; for hour and half there raged
succession of angry scenes that beat a gorgeous record. Mr. G. and
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, coming and going from division lobbies, were made
objects of rival ovations. Liberals and the Irish leaped to their feet,
madly cheering when <span class="sc">Premier</span> dropped in. Few minutes earlier or
later came <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>; instantly Unionists on their feet wildly
cheering. Outside all London making holiday. Here hon. gentlemen
almost clutching at each other's throats across the beneficently
wide floor. Instead of wedding festivities and national holiday
depleting House it was fuller than ever. <span class="sc">Villiers</span> came down to
give his vote against
Closure; Unionists
rapturous round their
Grand Old Man. The
other side had Mr. G.
with his fourscore
years and four. <span class="sc">Villiers</span>
of Wolverhampton
topped him by
seven years. Nearly
carried him into division
lobby shoulder
high; beat hasty retreat
after doing this
last service to his
country.</p>

<p>"Fact is, you know,
<span class="sc">Toby</span>," he said, "I'm
not quite the young
fellow I used to be;
can't stand the racket
as was easy enough
some sixty or seventy
years ago. If they'll
kindly excuse me, I'll
go and take a walk
with the crowd to see
the illuminations in
Piccadilly. That will
be delightfully quiet
after this turmoil."</p>

heard terrific cheers that welcomed this falling off. Proposed to bring

being order of day, why not let them enter rose-garlanded, led by
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> on one side, and <span class="sc">Joey C.</span> on the other?
Guaranteed
a noble reception from grateful and gratified Opposition. But some
difference of opinion arose within little circle of Stalwarts, and proposal
abandoned. Drifted in one by one, amid stream of Opposition.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Clauses 5, 6, 7, and 8 added to Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Conybeare</span> went out a-shearing, and came home
shorn. Asked leave to make personal explanation; House naturally
thought this would assume form of apology for attack on <span class="sc">Speaker</span>,
of which note was taken on Tuesday. Permission accordingly given.
Turned out nothing further from <span class="sc">Conybeare's</span> thoughts. First began
by scolding unnamed persons for not rising in his defence on Tuesday;
then proceeded to argue with Mr. G. and <span class="sc">Speaker</span> on point of order
involved in his earlier attack. Incidentally, as the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, in
indignant tones, pointed out, he repeated the charges embodied in his
letter. House long listened, with amazing patience. But there are
limits to forbearance; at end of quarter of an hour the <span class="sc">Curse of
Camborne</span> had reached these; his letter declared by unanimous vote
to be a breach of privilege; a lame apology wrung from his unwilling

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
